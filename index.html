        <h2>Favourite Projects:</h2>
        <h3>Bus ticket sales and coupon system:</h3>
        <p>This was the first full project I'd ever worked on by myself. I went in with a salesman and sold my services and I did all the rest.
          I had meetings with the key stake holders for the project. I analyzed their existing system, which was DBASE flat files based.
          I then designed an Oracle solution that would track the routes the buses went on, and their timetables. It tracked what the ticket and cash sales were, as loaded from a drive from the buses.
          They could then run reports off the system to see which routes were the most profitable and at which times.

          To put the project together, I had to install the Oracle Database on a Windows Server, configure it, set up the users, roles, etc.
          I designed the database, the tables, primary and foreign keys, etc.
          I built the forms and reports that the system had to use, including the menu system.

          I also built an interface to load the files from the bus's harddrives into the system.

          I built that interface using Delphi. The form did a host call out to the executable, which then ran the delphi program which loaded the DBASE files across.

          I learned a lot on that project. It was loads of fun.
